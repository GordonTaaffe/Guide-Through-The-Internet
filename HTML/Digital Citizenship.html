  <h2 style="color:white">A digital citizen refers to a person utilizing information technology (IT) in order to engage in society, politics, and government.
      K. Mossberger, et al. define digital citizens as "those who use the Internet regularly and effectively".</h2>
  <h3 style="color:white">Intro rephrase.</h3>
  <h1 style="color:cyan"><b>Digital citizenship defined</b></h1><br>
  
      <h3 style="color:white">Digital citizenship reflects our quest to help students, as well as ourselves, develop the skills and perspectives necessary to live a 
      digital lifestyle that is safe, ethical and responsible, as well as inspired, innovative and involved.We want all students to be able to
	  assume the roles of researcher, participant and leader as they build communities that effectively span their physical and online worlds.
	  Toward that end, digital citizenship seeks to provide guidance, perspective and activities to help them do so.<br><br>
	  
	  Digital lifestyle<br><br>
	  
	  Has many new qualities<br><br>
	  
	  One of these qualities is the degree to which we are empowered in the digital era.<br><br>
	  
	  We live in real life (RL), as well as in immersive reality(IR0), the world on the other end of our smart devices, which are, to quote MIT’s
	  sherry Truckle, “always on, and always on us”. We occupy two ecosystems, our natural ecosystem and a world of real time media that travels 
	  with us wherever we go.<br><br>
	  
	  Many are concerned that those we meet online might be unscrupulous or dangerous, and that our children might not have the discernment or skills
	  necessary to protect themselves and their friends.<br><br>
	  
	  Prior to the internet, adults had a better chance of witnessing the identity play and development of maturing youth and therefore had a better 
	  chance of being involved when necessary.<br><br>
	  
	  An interest in children’s safety may inspire our interest in digital citizenship, an equally important concern should also guide us: casting Digital
	  Citizenship in positive terms. We need to portray digital citizenship for what it is: the most positive development in education since the internet 
	  became a fixture in our lives.<br><br>
	  
	  It gives us the chance we have been waiting for to develop approaches to education that reflect the ethical and innovative perspectives we cherish, 
	  and to build the futures we want for ourselves and our children.<br><br></h3>
	  
	  <h1 style="color:cyan">History of digital citizenship</h1><br>
	  <h3 style="color:white">In retrospect, our interest in digital citizenship began when we started questioning the impact of living a technological lifestyle. Perhaps an official
	  beginning point for this consideration in education is ISTE’s (international society of technology in education) original set of educational technology 
	  standards, created in 2000, which included “standard VI. Social, ethical, legal and human issues.” However, we had to wait for the ISTE refresh standards
	  of 2008 to see the term “digital citizenship” to appear as “standard 4. Promote and model Digital citizenship and responsibility.”<br><br>
	  
	  With the release of “version3” of ISTE’s student standards in 2016, digital citizenship is now firmly embedded in our vision of the future as standard#2.</h3><br>
	  
	  <h1 style="color:cyan">Do we need a special form of citizenship?</h1><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:white">In retrospect, our interest in digital citizenship began when we started questioning the impact of living a technological lifestyle. Perhaps an official
	  beginning point for this consideration in education is ISTE’s (international society of technology in education) original set of educational technology 
	  standards, created in 2000, which included “standard VI. Social, ethical, legal and human issues.” However, we had to wait for the ISTE refresh standards of
	  2008 to see the term “digital citizenship” to appear as “standard 4. Promote and model Digital citizenship and responsibility.”<br><br>
	  
	  The first says that just because we are dealing with issues related to digital culture, we don’t need special kinds of considerations for citizenship, ethics
	  or character education.<br><br>
	  
	  Immersive reality, as well as living in two places at once, has created a new world that invents new behaviours with complex moral implications that we have not
	  dealt with before.<br><br>
	  
	  The digital domain is different enough from life in pre-Internet times to warrant a number of special ethical considerations. Therefore, currently we are better 
	  served by developing digital citizenship as a new area of interest which draws upon, reinterprets and finds new and focused ways to apply the ethics of yesterday
	  to the future world of emerging technology.<br><br>
	  
	  But for now, digital citizenship deserves its own, specialized focus</h3><br>
	  
	  <h1 style="color:cyan">The three core themes and nine elements of digital citizenship<h1>

	    <li>Digital citizenship’s most challenging aspects</li><br>
		<li>Expansive territory</li><br>
		<li>Human activity</li><br>
		<li>Technology or the internet</li><br>
	  </ul>
	  <h3 style="color:white">Challenge by dividing digital citizenship into three broad core themes: REP/ respect, education and protection.
	  <table>
	    <tr>
		  <td>Core theme category</td>
		  <td>Elements</td>
		</tr>
		<tr style="color:black">
		  <td>1.	Respect</td>
		  <td>Etiquette, Access and Law</td>

	  <h1 style="color:cyan">Core theme 1. Respect yourself and others<h1>
	  <h3 style="color:white">Core theme 1. Respect yourself and others<br><br>
	  
	  The three digital citizenship elements that fit within the core theme of respect are: etiquette, access and law.<br><br>
	  
	  1. Etiquette<br><br>
	  
	  Etiquette focuses on the social norms involved in interacting with one another.<br><br>
	  
	  Electronic communication<br><br>
	  
      Those who fail to consider the implications of the emails or tweets they send. The bottom line is that while the
	  basics of etiquette that we have inherited from our parents’ generation are still in play, new technology requires
	  new etiquette considerations.<br><br>
	  
	  Assumes a place in our lives and schools.<br><br>
      2. Access<br><br>
      
      Digital access is about our connection to resources, information and the online opportunities that characterize personal and
	  professional development in the digital age.<br><br>	  
	  
	  Our concern with access is not restricted just to physical access to devices and bandwidth. Socioeconomic barriers can also prevent students from accessing
	  the tools of opportunity.<br><br>
	  
	  Classroom must also provide the access needed to make their program successful.<br><br>
	  
	  1:1 access for all students can often also provide similar opportunities for families and community members who have few other options.<br><br>
	  
	  3. Digital Law<br><br>
	  
	  The three basic areas: the collecting and sharing of personal information; copyright and the issues surrounding the use of other people’s material; and criminal 
	  behaviour that may abrogate both older laws that were in force before the internet became a facture in daily life, as well as newer laws that are related to issues
	  that have developed because of new digital environments.<br><br>
	  
	  Digital copyright, software pirating, stealing online identities, internet scams and hacking<br><br>
	  
	  Online resources, the sharing of inappropriate images like sexting (the taking and sharing of sexually explicit images) and cyberbullying, that is acts of mean and often
	  threatening behaviour that occur online.<br><br>
	  
	  “Dark Web”<br><br>
	  
	  Dark web is often associated with criminal activities, such as the buying and selling of illegal information and goods, and its use by ISIS and other criminal organisations.<br><br>
	   
	  States such as Utah, Washington and Nebraska are working on laws that focus on digital citizenship in general and student protection in general to help address some of the legal issues
	  mentioned in this section.</h3><br><br>
	  
	  <h1 style="color:cyan">Core theme 3. Protect yourself and others</h1>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:white">1. Digital rights and responsibilities.<br><br>
	  
	  All of us must be vigilant as we watch for signs of problems online. In addition, we see them. In this respect, our students need guides to help to learn about the pitfalls, as well as the
	  opportunities, of social media. As they develop their skills, they need to become guides themselves.<br><br>
	  
	  2.	Digital security.<br><br>
	  
	  This element focuses on the processes we use to protect our information.<br><br>
	  
	  Such as the use of firewalls and virus protection.<br><br>
	  
	  Personal information to reveal online. Social media has made this issue especially urgent. Our security, and the security of others, is the responsibility of everyone.<br><br>
	  
	  3.	Digital health and wellness<br><br>
	  
	  This element addresses the need to find a balance between the lives that we live in the real world and those we live online. We live in an era in which people are constantly “on their devices,”
	  while ignoring those in their immediate environments.<br><br>
	  
	  It is our responsibility to help students balance the many sides of technology and to help students understand the social, interpersonal and physical implications of spending too much time online.</h3><br><br>
	  
	  <h1 style="color:cyan">Approaches to internet access</h1><br><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:white">A common misinterpretation of this issue sees it as being purely technical in nature, concerned largely with the practicalities of internet filtering and blocking. Instead, access should be seen first
	  and foremost as an expression of community values. How a school approaches internet access makes a statement about those values. Because values vary at least somewhat from community to community, each community
	  approaches internet access somewhat differently. Therefore, internet access should begin as a discussion, the goal of which is to clarify those values.<br><br>
	  
	  How differently do schools approach the issue of internet access? There are two dimensions that need to be considered: material that students are allowed to search for and read and view, and original material that
	  students are allowed to create and post themselves. With regard to the first, some schools drastically limit internet access, while others use no filtering at all. Many fall somewhere in between. With regard to posting,
	  some schools allow very little, while others actively pursue the development and publishing of student online portfolios.</h3><br><br>
	  
	  <h1 style="color:cyan">Involve everyone in the internet access discussion</h1><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:white">Whether students are at home, at school or out socialising, they access the same social media and online resources. It is all one, seamless life to them. It will only become more seamless as technology evolves. Access
	  may happen presently through their laptops, smart pads, phones; however, it will happen through whatever connected, wearable and even embedded technology finds its way into their lives in the future.<br><br>
	  
	  Given how pervasive access already is, discussions about access should involve all community stakeholders. We need parents, students, teachers, administrators, school board members and members of the larger community to be part
	  of the conversation.</h3><br>
	  
	  <h1 style="color:cyan">How does monitoring work?</h1><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:white">Currently, one approach to addressing the issue of student internet access, is the use of monitoring systems. The diagram depicts the steps involved in digital monitoring, the idea being to allow students the online freedom.</h3><br>
	  
	  <h1 style="color:cyan">Applied digital citizenship</h1><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:white">The reality is the digital citizenship is relatively new and is experiencing growing pains as it tries to find its way into communities and more importantly, everyday curriculum. One way to see digital citizenship in action
	  is to examine what is currently happening in classrooms.<br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:yellow;">“global collaboration is necessary to show students that they are part of something bigger than them. That the world needs to be protected and that we need to care for all people. You can show them pictures of kids
	  in other countries but why not have them speak to each other? Then the caring can begin.”</h3><br> 
	  
	  <h1 style="color:cyan">K12 school district</h1><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:white">At Longview independent school district, TX, IT Director Brian Pitts and his team use online monitoring software to flag up early warning signs related to online safety. Rather than simply blocking and filtering online content, this software
	  allows Longview ISD to monitor student devices. This approach allows educators and administrators to review and assess logged activity, based on contextualized information, so that they can intervene, educate and safeguard as necessary.<br><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:yellow;">“it provides automated help detecting symptoms and indicators of online safety concerns which is invaluable to our district. As log files are collected at a rate of tens of millions of entries per day, it would be impossible
	  for us to pick out all the safeguarding issues on our own.”</h3><br>
	  
	  <h5 style="color:white"> - Brian Pitts, Longview Texas Independent School District</h5><br>
	  
	  <h1 style="color:cyan">The future of digital citizenship</h1><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:white">Given that digital citizenship responds to changes in technology and given that the future of technological evolution is very difficult to predict, no one can say what digital citizenship will look like going forward. However, here are some broad themes
	  that seem destined to become the focus of much attention and debate in the near term.<br><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:cyan;">1.	Will digital citizenship align itself with a philosophical or research base?</h3><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:white">While many seem to view digital citizenship as arising from nowhere-because the technology that drives it seems to do so- others see it as an extension of already existing theoretical and applied traditions, such as character education and socioemotional 
	  learning.</h3><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:cyan;">2.	How should students be involved digital citizenship movement?</h3><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:white">The current reality is that adults tend to make all the internet rules for students. When they do so, they deprive students of much needed chances to flex their ethical muscles. If students aren’t allowed to frame the system that guides their use of technology
	  and the internet, then they tend to game the system. Expanding student involvement in framing the system promises to be a much debated topic going forward.</h3><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:cyan;">3.	The extreme edge of digital citizenship- what shall we do about shirts with Wi-Fi and neuro-enhancing chips?</h3><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:white">With so much concern focused on immediate issues of digital citizenship, like copyright infringement and cyberbullying, sometimes it is difficult to see down the road. The reality is that a number of the technologies we use today will seem tame in comparison to
	  what is right around the corner, including connected clothing, real thinking caps that raise test scores, contact lenses that provide internet connectivity, the internet of things, and much more. How will communities respond to these technologies? How will we provide
	  students the opportunities to think the changes that await them?</h3><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:cyan;">4.	Will our approach to the internet in education be driven by fear, or by a more positive approach to the world of online possibilities?</h3><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:white">Many in the digital citizenship field are very focused on cyberbullying, sexting and other hot button issues. This very understandable. Just one story about harm coming to children because they trusted the wrong people online induces justifiable fear. However, we
	  need to couple any fear-based approach we use with another approach: mining and shaping the internet experience for positive reasons.  For example, it makes sense to warn students that the digital trail they leave behind them wherever they go online that can so indelible
	  that they last a lifetime- causing some to some to refer to them as digital tattoos. We have all heard stories about a tweet gone awry which cost someone a relationship or a job. However, it also makes sense to balance this by having students create deliberate digital footprints
	  in the form portfolios and web resources that tell the story of themselves as their lives as they want them told. Students need to develop the skills and perspectives necessary to flourish in their online environments.</h3><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:cyan;">5.	What kinds of home-school-community connections do we want to cultivate?</h3><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:white">The reality is that our online lives travel with us, and cross the boundaries our school, professional and personal lives rather effortlessly. Therefore, our digital lifestyles and the digital citizenship concerns we have about them, are simply to big for schools to handle by
	  themselves. We need to find ways for educators, parents community members work together effectively to address the ethical issues that our digital lifestyles present us. We need to ask, what kinds of home-school-community connections should we develop to best prepare students to be
	  ideal digital citizens?</h3>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:cyan;">6.	What is the role of software management tools in protecting, managing and providing opportunities for students in the arena of student digital citizenship activity?</h3><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:white">Companies like Impero offer sophisticated systems that can help schools track and manage student’s internet activity. Have we reached the point where using these kinds of systems will need to become the norm? if so, what will be our goals is using such an approach? Even if we do use
	  such systems, all they can do is give us raw data that we then need to address on a school-by-school and student-by-student basis. What form will our response take? communities need to determine the values that will drive their input from all the stakeholders associated with a school
	  community.</h3><br>
	  
	  <h1 style="color:cyan">Conclusion- how should we teach digital citizenship?</h1><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:white">Years ago the highly respected educational theorist John Dewey stated that schools need to become mini societies, mirroring the real life social activities of the students they teach. These are wise words for us as we embrace a world in need of the guidance digital citizenship can offer.
	  We can’t afford to be reactive to changes and innovations in society. Instead, we must become change leaders who welcome the new landscape of social media for the opportunities it affords us to create new pedagogies.<br><br>
	  
	  This leads us to a final issue that is clearly on the table and in need of our attention: should we teach digital citizenship as a stand-alone topic or integrate it across the curriculum? The simple answer is both. However, the future of successful digital citizenship lies in addressing it
	  throughout curriculum, as well as throughout our personal and professional lives. We enter and ethically challenging arena whenever we pick up our smart phone or go online. Our students need to understand this. They need to understand that digital citizenship concerns arise everywhere, in biology
	  and history class, as well as in their private lives. Given our already overcrowded curriculum, finding effective ways to integrate digital citizenship throughout the school day, will be challenging. But it is a challenge we must take on.</h3><br>
	  
	  <h1 style="color:cyan">Differentiating factors</h1><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:white">The digital citizenship institute empowers schools and communities to think, act and connect responsibly and respectfully on and offline. They do this by giving participants the tools and training they need to brainstorm, design, collaborate and execute on projects that solve real world problems
	  and create positive digital footprints.<br><br>
	  
	  The digital citizenship institute provides a community-driven approach to educating and empowering digital communities. The digital citizenship institute turns negatives into positives, raising awareness and creating opportunities for social good to ultimately transform participants into active designers,
	  creative thinkers, global collaborators, problem solvers and justice-oriented digital citizens.</h3>
